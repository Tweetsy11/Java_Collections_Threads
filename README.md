## Introduction

This repository contains practical exercises designed to enhance understanding of Java collections and threading. Each exercise is crafted to demonstrate specific concepts and best practices in object-oriented programming. The aim is to provide a solid foundation for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge in these areas.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Tweetsy11/Java_Collections_Threads/releases). Each release contains compiled versions of the exercises along with source code. Download the necessary files, and follow the instructions provided to run the programs.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- **Git**: To clone the repository and manage version control.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tweetsy11/Java_Collections_Threads.git
```

## Topics Covered

This repository includes exercises that touch on various important topics in computer science and programming. Here are the key areas you will explore:

- **Algorithms**: Understand common algorithms and their implementations.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Learn about threading and synchronization in Java.
- **Data Structures**: Explore various data structures like lists, sets, and maps.
- **Debugging**: Gain skills in identifying and fixing bugs in your code.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Apply principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Project Management**: Understand how to manage code using Git and GitHub.

## Usage

After downloading the release files, you can run the Java programs directly in your IDE. Here‚Äôs how to execute a sample program:

1. Open your IDE.
2. Import the downloaded project.
3. Locate the `src` folder containing the Java files.
4. Right-click on the desired Java file and select `Run`.

### Example Programs

Below are a few examples of what you can find in this repository:
