# Java (Collections and Threads)

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **collections** and **threads** implemented in **Java programming language**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrates how to protect data by restricting direct access to object attributes.
- **Inheritance**: Implements hierarchical relationships between classes to promote code reuse and scalability.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while executing overridden methods dynamically.
- **Abstraction**: Uses abstract classes and interfaces to define a general structure for objects while hiding unnecessary details.
- **Interfaces**: Encourages modularity and flexibility by defining behavior through interfaces.
- **Enumerations**: Implements enums to define a fixed set of constants, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **Exception Handling**: Implements custom exceptions to manage runtime errors and ensure robustness in object-oriented design.
- **Collections Management**: Manages data using fundamental structures to store and manipulate information efficiently.  
- **Multithreading**: Handles the creation and execution of multiple threads to run tasks concurrently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java for implementing oject-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- **Build System**: Apache Ant for compiling and running Java projects.
- **IDE**: Apache NetBeans for development and debugging.  
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.  
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or later, required to compile and run Java applications.
- **Apache Ant**: Used to automate the build process for Java applications.  
- **IDE**: Required to read and understand code efficiently.    
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/Java_Collections_Threads.git
   cd Java_Collections_Threads
   ```

2. **Choose a Directory**

   To navigate to one of the directories containing the projects (e.g., Exercises 01):

   ```sh
   cd Exercises 01
   ```

3. **Build the Project**

   To build the project inside the selected directory:

   ```sh
   ant clean build
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Project**

   To execute the compiled project:

   ```sh
   ant run
   ```
